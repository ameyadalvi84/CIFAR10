Machine Learning on CIFAR10 dataset

Date - 11.06.2020

first attempt on CIFAR10 data set with own built convolutional model resulted in
train_accuracy of 94.43% and validation accuracy od 72.48%
Test result are really bad, with loss - 568.41, and accuracy of - 52.3%.

Second attempt on CIFAR10 data set using VGG16 architechture.
Serious issue of overfitting is evident between train and valuation dataset.
Test result are better than first attempt but overall they are bad
loss - 1.72 & accuracy - 59.25%
Need to try data augmentations.
